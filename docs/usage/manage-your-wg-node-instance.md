# Manage your wg-node instance

When everything is set up properly and already running,
it is time to send commands to the **wg-node** instance and have some fun.
The only way to do it is to use **wg-node API**.
You can read more about it [in the next section](/wg-node/api/introduction).

!!! tip

    You can skip to the
    [**wg-node API client libraries** section]() if you don't want to dig that deep. 
    Choose a library suitable for the programming language you use 
    and send requests to **wg-node** without thinking how the **wg-node API** works.
